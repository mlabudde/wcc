## To Do items

- create a template for Crosstables
	- 4, 5, and 6 rounds!

- What we're reading - add two more books!

- extract crosstables from USCF site and convert them to WCC blog site format

- 'Waukesha Memorial' page -
	- smaller font for next tournament
	- most recent need not be special/different than others (maybe color?)
	- list all in table with three columns
		- Year, Champion(s), Crosstable Link	
- 'Past Tournaments/Champions' page -
	- separate into two pages
		 a) Past Tournaments
		 	- we could list them
			- or, we could link to the USCF site (single link)
			- or, we could embed the USCF page into the WCC site (on this page)
			- other thoughts/options?
		 b) Club Champions
		 	- two columns: Year, Champion(s)
- ‘Games’ page - 
	- try to populate this with a few games
	- investigate what tools/sites others use to publish games to the web
- Other thoughts?
